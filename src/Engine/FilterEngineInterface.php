     * 
     *  Thats why this interface is "readonly" - generally only user can write values into post or get form 
     * 
     *  For grabbing values which was saved in sessions, cookies, database - we should implemet the FilterStorageInterface
     * 
     *  In filters we can store near to anything (typically strings, ints and arrays)
